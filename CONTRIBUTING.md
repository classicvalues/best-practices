# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the NGINX best practices!  
If you have any questions that aren't covered by this document, please [open an issue][issue] or start a [Q&A discussion][discussion] in GitHub.

## Getting Started

Write the documentation in [Markdown][md] and build the NGINX documentation site using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
NGINX documentation uses the [CommonMark][cmnmark] Markdown flavor.

## Adding a new document

1. Clone this repo.
1. Check out a new feature branch from main.
1. Make a copy of the [template](template.md) in the [content](/content/) directory.
1. Give your new file a name that represents the content.
1. Following the guidance in the template, build out your new best practice doc.
1. Make [atomic commits][atomic commits] as you work.
1. Open a [pull request][pr] when your work is ready for review.

[pr]: https://github.com/nginx/best-practices/pulls

## Style and Tone

Keep the following rules in mind when writing for and about NGINX:

1. Always write "NGINX" in all caps, except when referring to a command or process.

    For example:  
    "NGINX is the most popular web server on Earth."  
    "Use the `nginx -s reload` command to reload your configuration."

1. Use active voice. Tools like [Grammarly] and [Hemingway] can help you refine your content.
1. Don't assume the reader is a subject-matter expert. Give enough background information that a new NGINX user can understand and follow your instructions.

## Target Personae

NGINX is many things to many people. Those people perform various job roles across many different industries. Some of these roles may intersect.

When writing a best practice doc, you should approach the subject with one or two of the personae described in this section in mind. This helps ensure that the use case isn't too broad to apply to any individual user's real-world needs.
